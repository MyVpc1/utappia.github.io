[Why Linux on the Desktop is
Alive!](http://blog.mattrudge.net/2012/04/01/linux-desktop-lives/):

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

While helping to edit last week’s [Ubuntu Weekly
Newsletter](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuWeeklyNewsletter/Issue258), I
came across an article written by Tony Bradley of PC World entitled
[“Why Linux on the Desktop Is
Dead”](https://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/252516/why_linux_on_the_desktop_is_dead.html).
In it he cited his “30 days with Ubuntu Linux” test as proof that Linux
on the desktop is not, and will not be a credible option for users.  
<a name="more"></a>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

I don’t often use this blog to take exception to things I read
(otherwise it’s probably *all* I’d ever do), but in this case, I felt
that I had to respond.

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

Firstly my own experience of Linux on the desktop has been
overwhelmingly positive. All of my hardware works out of the box, and
within a few short weeks of having Ubuntu installed, I happily deleted
my Windows partition and I’ve never looked back. That’s over 5 years
ago. Now, it could be argued that as an IT professional, Linux would be
more accessible to me; however I’ve also installed Ubuntu on my wife’s
netbook. She downloads music, browses the web, sends emails, uses
productivity packages, prints documents, watches videos, and makes video
calls – and has absolutely no problem with the operating system
whatsoever.

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

So, what were Mr Bradley’s main issues? I read through the entire
30-days article, and the five things he hated most about his Ubuntu
trial were:

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

1. Inability to sync and update his iPhone

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

To me this is a weak dislike. This is not Ubuntu’s or Linux’s fault.
Plus the ability to update iOS over the air has now all but removed the
need for me to connect my iPhone to my computer.

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

2. A dislike of the Banshee music player

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

There are many more music players in the sea, and writing off an
operating system as “dead on the desktop” because you don’t like one
application is really grasping at straws. If my reasons for giving up
Windows were that I didn’t like Windows Media Player, then that would be
a really petty argument.

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

3. Difficulties with Wine

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

Wine can be tricky, I admit; however installing any compatibility layer
to run code that’s native to another operating system is going to be
error-prone. Wine does a very good job at providing access to some
Windows-only applications, but in my opinion it’s better to find a Linux
alternative, and only go down the Wine route if you absolutely can’t
live without a certain Windows program.

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

4. The feeling of “swimming upstream”.

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

I really did take issue with this one. As someone who has struggled with
(and blogged about) certain vagaries of Microsoft programs and operating
systems, this rankled. Ubuntu’s job is *not* to be a Linux-based Windows
look-alike. Many things are, in fact, easier with Ubuntu – setting up
and publishing websites for one. If there’s a problem, then a huge
community is instantly accessible to provide help.

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

When you are using a different operating system it is only to be
expected that certain things don’t operate the way you would immediately
expect. “I really hate my new Ford because it doesn’t look like my old
Toyota” would be a foolish comment, but not when it comes to computer
operating systems it seems.

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

Mr Bradley’s comment that “if Ubuntu Linux was a microwave–I would have
to first research obscure types of food uniquely crafted to work with
the Ubuntu Linux microwave, then press the magic button enabling the
food to be cooked, and search through forums and online help to find the
specific way to rewire my microwave to work with that particular food”
is just plain wrong. This is based on his attempts to get his VPN
connection working. I don’t think that it’s counter-intuitive to type
“VPN” in to the Ubuntu Software Center if you’re looking for…ummm…a VPN
client!

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

As a 100% Linux user, who occasionally has to use Windows on another PC,
I now find the Windows way of doing things to be counter-intuitive,
unhelpful, nagging, and awkward. When fixing a friend’s Windows 7
installation recently, I couldn’t wait to get away from the busy,
irritating, pop-up dialog boxes and back to the calm and elegance of my
Linux installation.

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

5. Linux flamers

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

True, there are some. Mr Bradley describes them as “arrogant,
self-righteous jerks”, and there certainly are many of them out there –
in support of whatever operating system or gadget you want to choose.
Critically, though, I think many were taking exception to his desire for
Ubuntu to be an identical-looking slot-in replacement for Windows. This
is never going to be the case – and shouldn’t be, either.

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

A further factual inaccuracy in the 30-days article had to do with the
comparative file-sizes of ODT vs DOCX files. Mr Bradley states that his
ODT file was 500% larger than the DOCX. That may be true for small
files, but as the file size increases, the ODT format becomes much more
economical. A 764k DOCX file would be only 438k as an ODT, for example.
The article states that for an organization with thousands upon
thousands of files, those KBs will add up, and no organization wants to
have to purchase or maintain five times more storage capacity for the
exact same data”. True, but not true – since the overhead only seems to
be an issue with small files.

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

I suppose I’m really wondering why the follow-up article was written.
The original 30-day test was performed with Ubuntu 11.04 in June of last
year. This article was written on March 24th of this year, and didn’t
really seem to add anything to the debate. The headline, though, is
certainly attention-grabbing enough and guarantees a few page-views.

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

While he acknowledges Ubuntu’s wonderful and knowledgeable users, he
also says that “it’s often difficult to find them through the sea of
self-righteous flamers who berate you for not knowing what you’re
doing”. That’s not true or fair at all – the Ubuntu Forums are a
treasure trove of genuinely helpful folks. These people give their time
and expertise for free to help out other users, so occasionally an
element of frustration can creep in when a user wants a Windows clone,
and acts like you owe them something because they decided to try Linux.

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

For those of us who get on perfectly happily with Ubuntu “it doesn’t
change the fact that you’re part of a negligible market segment”. I
don’t recall making *any* decision in life based on belonging to the
biggest market segment. History has proved time and again that the
majority can be very sincerely wrong. Also, since Linux is not a
commercial project, it doesn’t actually *need* a large market share to
succeed.

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

In the end, I just feel frustrated, because I don’t consider these type
of articles to be helpful at all. It seems to be Linux-bashing for the
sake of readership figures. I’m not saying that Ubuntu is better than
Windows, but I do feel that, after giving Ubuntu a 30 day trial and only
being able to come up with five fairly weak reasons for disliking it, Mr
Bradley is drastically exaggerating when he proclaim’s Ubuntu’s desktop
death. The death or life of an operating system depends on those who use
it – and with tens (possibly hundreds) of millions of desktop users, I
think that indicates that Linux on the desktop is very much alive.
