<h2 id="production">Production</h2>
<p>The origin of all value, FOSS or otherwise, is in the production of
something.  Every other form on contribution, anything else that adds
value to FOSS, comes from the refinement, combination, distribution or
transformation of this original production.  The most common form of
production in FOSS is written code.  More attention is paid to written
code than any other form of production, and contributions are (as stated
in the previous post) more commonly measured by the quantity of code
that any other metric.  Even in other forms of production, in artwork
and documentation, the origin of value comes from the production, with
other modes of contribution only adding value by the refinement,
combination, distribution or transformation of that production.  </p>
<h2 id="_1"><a name="more"></a></h2>
<h2 id="replacement">Replacement</h2>
<p>In most consumable products, the base value of something is equal to
what it would cost to replace it’s consumption.  That is, the base value
for a widget is the cost that is required to produce a new widget to
replace it.  If you were to give that widget to somebody, you would have
less than you had before.  But with software this isn’t the case.  With
software we can send out as many copies of an application as we want,
and never have less than we started with.  With a replacement cost of
zero, the base value of any given copy of code is also zero.  That is
why for software in general, and even more so for Free and Open Source
software, it is only the creation of something new that matters.  </p>
<h2 id="creation">Creation</h2>
<p>Because consumption of these goods does not decrease the supply of them,
the value exists not in replacing what is lost, but in creating
something that didn’t previously exist.  If a talented hacker were to
reproduce, from scratch, an exact duplicate of the Linux kernel, he
would have created no more value than somebody who simply made a copy of
the existing kernel.  Likewise if somebody were to simply duplicate the
exact features of one application in another, they have produced no more
value than a simple copy of the original.  The value of creation, then,
is determined entirely by how much of the creation is new or different
from what has been created previously.  </p>
<h2 id="value">Value</h2>
<p>Most programmer know that Lines of Code (LOC) is a poor metric for
judging a person’s productivity, mostly because bad code can be written
quickly and in large quantities, while good code is most often small and
requires quite a bit of time spent on thinking.  It is equally deficient
as a metric of contributed value, both for these same reasons, and also
some that are more specific to contribution.<br/>
As previously stated, the value of code is determined by how much of it
is novel or different from what came before.  A 1,000 line contribution
of a replacement kernel module, where 90% of the functionality is
identical to the previous module, does not necessarily contain the same
value as a 1,000 line contribution of a new module where none previously
existed.  A contribution where 100% of the functionality is the same can
only contribute a value equal to the difference in quality (in terms of
efficiency, cleanliness, stability, etc), which is in no way
proportional to the amount of code.<br/>
Code contributed to fix a problem in existing code often has a value
proportional to the size of the change, and should be properly counted
as a contribution of equal value.  However, it’s value comes from a
deficiency in previous contributions, and those contributions should
therefore be valued an equal amount less.  If you were to purchase a
dozen eggs, find that one was rotten, and then purchase an additional
good egg, that additional purchase has a full value, but the original
can only be valued at 11 eggs, not a full dozen.  Just as you would not
consider this scenario to result in a real value of 13 eggs, we can not
consider the original value of contributions and their subsequent fixes
as having a cumulative real value.<br/>
Finally we must consider the actual use of a contribution when
determining it’s total value.  Again as was stated in my <a href="http://mhall119.com/2012/04/distribution-is-contribution/" title="Distribution is Contribution">previous
post</a>,
FOSS developers derive value from their work being used by others, the
amount of use any given contribution receives, then, will determine its
total value.  A contribution to a popular application or part of an
application must be considered of greater total value than a
contribution of equal size to a less popular application or part of an
application<a href="http://mhall119.com/tag/ubuntu/feed/#footer-1">[1]</a>.
 Contributions to a part of the Linux kernel used in a majority of
deployments adds more total value than an equal sized contribution to a
part of the kernel used in a very narrow range of deployments.</p>
<div>

[1] This should not discourage people from contributing to less popular
applications, where their contributions are likely to form a much larger
portion of the total value of the application, and thus provide them
with a larger share of the value received by it’s use.
