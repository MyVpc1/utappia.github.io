This is an introductory article for a series of articles for building, deploying, securing, maintaining, troubleshooting and administering your home server or any server in general. Introduction A server, either external (hosted on 3rd party providers) or internal (in your home) is a computer dedicated to run an instance of an application (software) capable of accepting requests from the client (your PC, smartphone/tablet, TV etc.) and giving responses accordingly. Servers can run on any computer including dedicated computers, which individually are also often referred to as \"the server\". Note that in theory, any computerized process that shares a resource to one or more client processes is a server. Materials and Methods Before we get started, I would suggest that you should get a member of your family (kids, brother/sister, grandma? ) or a friend involved to the DIY Home Server project because it will be more fun and entertaining than to work alino on the project. To be able to build a home server we need to understand some terms: Hardware Network Operating System Clients Hardware The computer that will take the role of a home server could be any spare computer lying around. Unfortunately though this would mean that the this computer will have to be 24/7 powered on, could be loud and the consumption of electricity would make it not viable for the role. That is why I suggest avoid using common computers for home server role but instead buying a credit card-sized single-board computer like: Raspberry Pi Banana Pi BeagleBoard Cubieboard Odroid This type of computers are low on power consumption, silent and generally provide more \"value for money\". The total return of investment exceeds the one that will be provided by a common computer. Network The network is the \"glue\" that connects our server with the various clients (as mentioned earlier). The network is consisted of Router Cables IP assignments Our router is actually a mini internet/dhcp server and its role is to provide Internet connection, IP addresses and data/requests deliverance, among other things through the cables to the the clients and vice versa. Operating System There are specialized free (as in beer and freedom of speech) operating systems for the server role that are compatible with the single-board computers that I mentioned earlier. Most popular among them are: Ubuntu Debian Arch Linux openSUSE Personally I prefer Ubuntu because of their predefined development cycle and the 5 years of support on software updates. You should choose the one that you are comfortable administering as this will be installed on the server for years to come. Clients Clients are any devices that connect and exchange information with our home server. The kind of exchange depends on the types of services that the server provides and the capabilities of the device that request those services. A home server usually provides: Centralized storage Media serving Information (calendar, contacts etc.) E-mail Security monitoring P2P file sharing Results and discussion Now that we've discussed the core terms of building a home intranet, we should be able to create a draft plan of the parts that we will need to succeed in our project. I should mention that building a home server not only pays off but it is fun and educative. So stay tuned for the next article either by subscribing to newsletter or following me at social nets.

Bundles are a great way to backup entire Git repositories. They also let you share changes without a network connection. Materials and Methods We will use the git bundle utility inside our local repository and also git merge to deploy our bundled repo. git bundle turns a repository into a single file that retains the versioning information of the entire project. Here are a list of options that are available: git bundle create <name-of-the-bundle> <git-rev-list-args> git bundle verify <file> git bundle unbundle <file> [<refname>...] Create a bundle While you are inside a repo run: git bundle create ../myrepo.bundle master It should print out something like this: Counting objects: 43, done. Delta compression using up to 2 threads. Compressing objects: 100% (39/39), done. Writing objects: 100% (43/43), 54.44 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done. Total 43 (delta 8), reused 0 (delta 0) This will create the bundle outside (one folder above) the repo and name it myrepo.bundle . When we created the file It was like we where just pushing our master branch to a remote, except it's contained in a file instead of a remote repository. Verify the bundle Before we move our bundle its a good idea to verify its content and check that the bundle file is valid and relevant to the current repository. While you are inside a repo run: git bundle verify ../myrepo.bundle It should print out something like this: The bundle contains this ref: 230b04bdd3367b2db73 refs/heads/master The bundle records a complete history. ../myrepo.bundle is okay Deploy the bundle Assuming that you have the myrepo.bundle file in /home/user and you have created a folder newrepo and initialized a git repository inside it. Here is a generic procedure: mkdir newrepo cd newrepo git init git bundle unbundle ../myrepo.bundle the last command will inform you with the HEAD of you repo f7243ba54eb7de4b76a0 HEAD Now you can merge the contents of myrepo.bubdle file with the one that you initialized inside the newrepo folder: git merge f7243b Alternative procedures are also available, so please follow the links provided on the References section Results and discussion As you can see once you create the bundle file you can easily move it to another folder on the same or an other machine. Assume you want to transfer the history from a repository R1 on machine A to another repository R2 on machine B. For whatever reason, direct connection between A and B is not allowed, but we can move data from A to B via some mechanism (USB flash drive, email, etc..). This way we can update R2 with development made on the branch master in R1.

The CUDA Toolkit includes a compiler for NVIDIA GPUs, math libraries, and tools for debugging and optimizing the performance of your applications. You'll also find programming guides, user manuals, API reference, and other documentation to help you get started quickly accelerating your application with GPUs Introduction This guide is based upon Ubuntu LTS, but same principles apply in also to more recent versions of Ubuntu as well. Let's start Materials and Methods Hardware You must have a nVIDIA GPU that supports CUDA, otherwise you can't program in CUDA code. Here's a list with the CUDA supported GPU models. Installation 1- NVIDIA Proprietary drivers Either use our nVIDIA installer script or use Jockey (Additional Drivers) or just pick the driver you want from the NVIDIA official website . 2- Download CUDA Toolkit 5.0 for Ubuntu I used the Ubuntu 11.10 32bit version (it's the latest version so far). So please dowload . 3- Fix the libglut.so error There will be an error when you'll try to install the CUDA 5.0 examples. The driver is trying to find the libglut.so file and it doesn't look for other versions, such as so.1, so.2 etc. First confirm that you have a libglut file sudo find /usr -name libglut\\* if it does so, symlink that file to libglut.so for 64bit sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libglut.so.3 /usr/lib/libglut.so for 32bit sudo ln -s /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libglut.so.3 /usr/lib/libglut.so 4- Install the CUDA Toolkit and Samples Press CTRL+ALT+F1 to open a shell -- yeah, we're going to do this in old CLI way, but there's no need to afraid the black and white terminal. 5- Shutdown the all the graphics Ubuntu uses lightdm, so you need to stop this service. sudo service lightdm stop 6- Run the installer Go to (cd) to the directory you have the CUDA installer (a file with *.run extension) and type the following: sudo chmod +x *.run sudo ./*.run Accept the Licence and Install only the CUDA 5 Toolkit and the Samples. DO NOT INSTALL the drivers because we have already done that. 7- Enable the nvcc compiler In order to compile CUDA code you have to use the nvcc compile. In that so you have to tweak some enviroment variables into your home bashrc file. 32 bit systems export PATH= $ PATH :/usr/local/cuda-5.0/bin export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-5.0/lib 64 bit systems export PATH= $ PATH :/usr/local/cuda-5.0/bin export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-5.0/lib64:/lib` If you want to compile a CUDA file (*.cu extension) you can use the following command: nvcc -o file file.cu ./file or use the NSight Eclipse Edition .

Architecturally speaking, internally, Macs are PC's so installing Ubuntu is something that may be a viable option for users that want to dual-boot MacOSX with Ubuntu. Introduction Just in case you are curious enough or you simply want to act similar to Linus Torvalds using GNU/Linux in Apple's hardware (Macbook Air) then follow this guide. As you can see from my picture above, I've tested it and is working 100% running Ubuntu. Meterials and Methods Step 1: Install rEFIT boot menu In order to install more than one operating systems into your Macbook Air, you'll need a boot-loader called rEFIT -- a boot menu and maintenance toolkit for EFI-based machines like the Mac hardware. Once you have it installed, you can use it to boot multiple operating systems easily, including triple-boot setups eg. Windows 8, Mountain Lion and Ubuntu 12.10. Geek-wise, it also provides an easy way to enter and explore the EFI pre-boot environment. The current release is 0.14 and tt is available in various forms. However, we need Mac disk image only, double click the installer, set it up and click finish. The steps to install rEFIt this way are as follows: Download and mount the rEFIt-0.14.dmg disk image. Right-click and select Open on the \"rEFIt.mpkg\" package. Follow the instructions and select your Mac OS X installation volume as the destination volume for the install. In case your Mac OS X installation on the hard disk no longer boots, you can boot from the Mac OS X Install Disc (hold down the ‘C' key while booting) and run \"Startup Disk\" from the \"Utilities\" menu. Once you've rEFIT installed, run the Partition Inspector application and press Analyze button. If everything went well, you'll see the rEFIt boot menu on the next restart. Otherwise have a look at rEFI's documentation . Apart from troubleshooting advices, there are some useful tips for customizing your all-new bootloader. Just to make sure we're all in the same page here, before you go to the next step, make sure that the app is working. So reboot your system and if you see a startup menu like the one above, you' re good to go. If not ... try again! Last but not least, ignore the Linux penguin (aka Tux) icon, and boot into Mountain Lion (for now). How to Uninstall rEFIT To get rid of rEFIt, open the \"Startup Disk\" preference pane and select \"Mac OS X\" as the operating system to boot. This will re-bless your Mac OS X volume and instruct the firmware to boot from it. Then rename or delete the \"efi\" folder. Step 2: Make space for Ubuntu installation Supposing you use the full SSD disk's size, you have to resize it and free some space -- min 10GB -- for Ubuntu. Don't worry, there is nothing to afraid of... but just in case backup your most important data before make any changes to the disk. The utility we are going to use is called Disk Utility. How to resize and partition in Mountain Lion Open Disk Utility (Applications > Utilities > Disk Utility.) Select your hard drive from the list on the left, and click the Partition tab on the right. You'll see the current partition layout. Click the right corner of the current partition and shrink it to the size you want. The display will show you the minimum size, so don't worry about going too far. Alternatively, just select the current partition and type in the final size (total hard drive space - amount you want Ubuntu to have) in the Size field on the right. Click apply. Disk Utility will shrink the current partition for you and free up space for your Ubuntu install. Resize first and then press Apply button. The resizing process needs about 1 min to be completed. After that you are ready to install Ubuntu at the free space along with Mountain Lion in a such a beautiful dual boot configuration. Step 3: Prepare Ubuntu USB Flash disk As far as I am concerned there is no optical drive into Macbook Air. After all it's too thin and so much insanely designed for a CD drive. Hence, you are going to install Ubuntu via a bootable USB flash disk. If you have a Windows PC, fire up Unetbootin app. If you have another Ubuntu PC, use my version script from UbuntuForums.org -- but modify it according to your needs. Otherwise, if you are a Mac-lover only, this procedure requires that you create an .img file from the .iso file you download. How to prepare Ubuntu flash disk in Mountain Lion Open the Terminal (in /Applications/Utilities/ or query Terminal in Spotlight). Convert the .iso file to .img using the convert option of hdiutil (e.g.,hdiutil convert -format UDRW -o ~/path/to/target.img ~/path/to/ubuntu.iso) Run diskutil list to get the current list of devices. Insert your flash media. Run diskutil list again and determine the device node assigned to your flash media (e.g. /dev/disk2). Run diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN (replace N with the disk number from the last command; in the previous example, N would be 2). Execute sudo dd if=/path/to/downloaded.img of=/dev/rdiskN bs=1m (replace /path/to/downloaded.img with the path where the image file is located; for example, ./ubuntu.imgor ./ubuntu.dmg). Using /dev/rdisk instead of /dev/disk may be faster If you see the error dd: Invalid number '1m', you are using GNU dd. Use the same command but replace bs=1m with bs=1M If you see the error dd: /dev/diskN: Resource busy, make sure the disk is not in use. Start the 'Disk Utility.app' and unmount (don't eject) the drive Run diskutil eject /dev/diskN and remove your flash media when the command completes. Restart your Mac and press alt/option key while the Mac is restarting to choose the USB stick. Step 4: Install Ubuntu alongside with Mountain Lion Now that your USB flash disk is ready, restart Macbook and press ALT key in order to select your first boot device. Go with Flash disk instead of SSD and voila... Ubuntu 12.10 is booting! Furthermore, thanks to the modern Ubuntu installation wizard, you no longer have to create partitions manually but select the appropriate option. My wireless network was automatically detected, based on Broadcom Corporation BCM4322 802.11a/b/g/n chip. Hence, I had no problem with Ubuntu installation. Everything went smoothly.

Linux users have the benefit of the tools that are provided by the community so the they can get the most out of the \"battery juice\". Introduction Three of the most power consumption monsters in a Laptop is the Graphics Card , Hard Disk and the CPU . Nowadays most of the latest CPUS's have Dynamic CPU frequency scaling (also known as CPU throttling) which is a technique in computer architecture where a processor is run at a less-than-maximum frequency in order to conserve power. Linux Kernel utilize this feature by automatically enabling the so-called Governance (Performance, On-Demand, Conservative, Power-save) For example if you manually set the Power-save state (with CPUfrequtils), you \"tell your kernel\" to try to increase the battery life of your laptop. The next too parts (Graphics Card, Hard Disk) have also a Power Saving modes but they are not always utilized well by the Linux Kernel. Personally, the one that I find most annoying when I use my laptop is that the Hard Disk never spins down to conserve power and therefore it decreases the battery life of my laptop. Increase the battery life with Laptop Mode Tools Laptop Mode Tools is a laptop power saving package for Linux systems. It allows you to increase the battery life of your laptop, in several ways. It is the primary way to enable the Laptop Mode feature of the Linux kernel, which lets your hard drive spin down . In addition, it allows you to tweak a number of other power-related settings using a simple configuration file. How to install Laptop Mode Tools According to its developer you should use the latest Debian package which is compatible with Ubuntu because the one that ships on Ubuntu Software Center is crippled so that some options don't work, the most notable of which are ENABLE_LAPTOP_MODE_ON_AC ENABLE_LAPTOP_MODE_WHEN_LID_CLOSED DISABLE_LAPTOP_MODE_ON_CRITICAL_BATTERY_LEVEL Supported 2.6.6+ Linux Kernel Mirrors of the latest version After you have downloaded the package, double-click and install it. Once installed you don't need to do anything ! If everything went OK, laptop mode will be activated automatically the next time you unplug your laptop from the mains. Tweak Laptop Mode Tools If you are curious about the options available for Laptop mode Tools (I bet you are !) you can make some minor changes to its configuration file to make it correspond to your personal needs. Open as administrator/root/sudo the file at /etc/laptop-mode/laptop-mode.conf Read carefully the available options and only make changes to the one that you are sure about Save it and close it! You are done Results and discussion For reference here are my changes : # # The drives that laptop mode controls. # Separate them by a space, e.g. HD=\"/dev/hda /dev/hdb\". The default is a wildcard, which will get you all your IDE and SCSI/SATA drives. # HD=\"/dev/sda\" # # The partitions (or mount points) that laptop mode controls. # Separate the values by spaces. Use \"auto\" to indicate all partitions on drives # listed in HD. You can add things to \"auto\", e.g. \"auto /dev/hdc3\". You can also specify mount points, e.g. \"/mnt/data\". # PARTITIONS=\"auto /dev/sda\\*\" ........ # # Read-ahead, in kilobytes. You can spin down the disk while playing MP3/OGG # by setting the disk readahead to a reasonable size, e.g. 3072 (3 MB). # Effectively, the disk will read a complete MP3 at once, and will then spin down while the MP3/OGG is playing. Don't set this too high, because the readahead is applied to _all_ files that are read from disk. # LM_READAHEAD=6072 NOLM_READAHEAD=128 Also, it is valuable to read the Frequently Asked Questions about Laptop Mode Tool , so please read some ports that I thought are important and if you have more I include the link for more information How do I check if laptop mode is enabled? Execute cat /proc/sys/vm/laptop_mode. If it contains a nonzero value, then laptop mode is enabled, if it says 0, then it isn't. I have a solid-state disk (SSD) in my machine. Should I enable any of the disk-related parts of laptop-mode-tools, or are they irrelevant? They may be relevant, because (a) laptop mode will reduce the number of writes, which improves the lifetime of an SSD, and (b) laptop mode makes writes bursty, which enables power saving mechanisms like ALPM to kick in. However, your mileage may vary depending on the specific hardware involved. For some hardware you will get no gain at all, for some the gain may be substantial. Spinning down too many times may kill hard drives Desktop hard drives are usually rated for only 40,000-50,000 spinups, and one spinup every 10 minutes will kill your 40,000-spinup HD in 277 days. So this is NOT recommended for server use, unless you increase the spinup interval dramatically, to say once every hour or two. Laptop hard drives are usually rated for around 300,000 spinups, so those will last about 2083 days or 6 years if you have them powered on 24-7. I have an SATA disk and it doesn't work. Spindown timeouts don't currently work on SATA drives, because the Linux kernel does not support that properly. There are patches available that add this support. Check out http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Problems_with_SATA_and_Linux for all SATA-on-Linux problems. For laptop mode to work, you want the libata_passthru patch. It will be included in the Linux kernel starting from version 2.6.15. Note: You also need a recent version of hdparm in order to make this work! If my machine crashes or runs out of power, will I lose all my work? If you have laptop mode enabled and your machine crashes, then you will lose up to MAX_LOST_WORK_SECONDS seconds of work. If you really need to have something written to disk, issue the \"sync\" command. If you have laptop mode enabled and your machine runs out of power, you will not lose as much work (provided you have an ACPI laptop, as most current PC laptops are) because laptop mode is automatically disabled when the battery almost runs out. What is the relationship between Laptop Mode Tools and the script in the kernel documentation? Laptop Mode Tools is a fork of the script in the kernel documentation. The script in the kernel documentation is currently pretty much unmaintained AFAIK, so I don't recommend using it. I set PARTITIONS and now it doesn't work anymore at all. You have to include the default partitions (the partitions of the drives listed in the HD configuration setting) as well. In version 1.06 and higher you can use the \"auto\" keyword to indicate \"and remount all of the default ones as well\". \"Default\" here means \"partitions that contain the device name of a hard drive in HD\", i.e. if your partition is /dev/hda3 and you have HD=/dev/hda, then /dev/hda3 is part of the default partitions, but if it is aptly named /dev/hdx7 then it isn't. :) I set REMOUNT_PARTITIONS to \"/ /mnt /usr\" and it doesn't work. You have to include the partitions' devices, not their mount points. So you should list things like \"/dev/hda2 /dev/hdb1\". If you're using version 1.06 or higher than you don't have this problem, as this version supports mount points as well as device names in REMOUNT_PARTITIONS (or PARTITIONS, as it's called in the new config file format introduced in version 1.07).

Even though we are aware that compiling is not recommended in Ubuntu, in this particular program is vital to do so. Introduction OGRE ( O bject-Oriented G raphics R endering E ngine) is a scene-oriented, flexible 3D engine written in C++ designed to make it easier and more intuitive for developers to produce applications utilizing hardware-accelerated 3D graphics. The class library abstracts all the details of using the underlying system libraries like Direct3D and OpenGL and provides an interface based on world objects and other intuitive classes. What can it do? Lots of things! See the features page for an up-to-date list of the current features. Also, take a look at the screenshots page to see for yourself the kinds of eye candy OGRE can pump out. Is OGRE a Game Engine? No. OGRE can be (and indeed has been) used to make games, but OGRE is deliberately designed to provide just a world-class graphics solution; for other features like sound, networking, AI, collision, physics etc, you will need to integrate it with other libraries, something several frameworks have done, and we have a collision / physics reference integration library as an example in our distribution. For more information click here . Materials and Methods 1. Install Depedencies As stated before, we are going to use the compile method instead of apt-get. Thus, you need you have installed all the necessary programs to do the job. sudo apt-get install build-essential automake libtool Next, you need to install the libraries required for OGRE. Compile-wise, you need the *.-dev packages. Type: sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev libfreeimage-dev libzzip-dev libxrandr-dev libxaw7-dev freeglut3-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libxt-dev libpng12-dev libglew1.6-dev 2. Download OGRE SDK Source First off you need to understand what version you would like to install. Personally, as being a beginner to OGRE I recommend you to install the stable branch. Here's a brief explanation of what there is available to the public. Development (default) branch : this is the latest development version where all the new features are being added. This is fine if you want to see the very latest features, but it is inherently the least stable version, and there may be interface-breaking changes going on here. Only use the trunk if you are confident in your ability to handle the odd problem. Maintenance branches : these are branches where the API is stable within a major version. Only bugfixes are applied to these branches, and no interface-breaking changes. Only one maintenance branch is actively maintained, representing the current stable version, but others may be present from previous stables. The maintenance branches are named after the stable major version, such as ‘v1-6′ or ‘v1-7′. The latest of these is the best branch to use if you want to keep up with the latest fixes, but need a stable development platform.[/tab] Download OGRE's Maintenance stable version ogre3d. OGRE Source 3. Compile OGRE SDK Once you have extracted OGRE into /home dir, then go in that folder in terminal way. Pay attention that in the following example, I have downloaded OGRE 1.8.1 version, thus the name scheme applying is ogre_src_v1-8-1. cd ogre_src_v1-8-1/ Create an empty directory, called \"Build\" and get inside: mkdir Build cd Build Trigger cmake, passing path to Ogre source directory in order to create a regular makefile. Ogre uses cmake instead of ./configure: cmake .. Normally you can just run 'make' but if you have multiple cores, you can decrease your compile time by doing this: make -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN` Once compilation is successful, you can install into the system (by default, /usr/local): sudo make install Otherwise, you can cmake and build OGRE using IDE, such as CodeBlocks, KDevelop or Eclipse. However, I like more using the terminal and gedit, rather than IDEs. Code blocks is a well-known IDE for programming. If you want to build OGRE through Code::Blocks then setup your cmake parameters properly. cmake -G \"CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles\" .. More information about Building project with Codeblocks can be found here Kdevelop4 is very nice, easy-to-use and modern IDE. After getting source, just open Kdevelop and click \"Project -> Open/Import Project...\" and show path to code (~/ogre_src_v1-8-1). You will have to choose build folder (eg /home/drpaneas/ogre_src_v1-8-1/build). Then wait a little bit for KDevelop to load and index the project files. For building click on button \"Build Selection\". For running click \"Execute\". Running first time \"Launch Configurations\" will pop up. You have to set executable file by selecting \"ogre_src_v1-8-1\", clicking \"+\" icon and choosing under (Launch Configuration) Executable \"/home/drpaneas/ogre_src_v1-8-1/build/bin/SampleBrowser_d\" as \"Project Target\".Then Run it (Shift+F9). More information here ... Select \"C/C++ / Makefile project with existing code\" as project type. In \"Existing code location\", click browse, and again,select openmw's folder. Also select \"Linux GCC\" as toolchain, then click \"Finish\". Now right-click on your project, and select \"Properties\". Go to \"C/C++ build\", uncheck \"use default build command\", and specify your command, likemake -j 4 -C ${ProjDirPath}../build That's it. Now you are able to launch the SampleBrowser, located at /Build/bin/ directory at your OGRE project. Results and discussion When you launch SampleBrowser for the very first time, it asks you to choose your Renderer. Being in Linux and native in Ubuntu, you have no choice but select OpenGL Rendering Subsystem; then click Accept. This is the menu of SampleBrowser. In there you can configure your settings and test any sample project that comes with OGRE SDK by default. Also, bare in mind that you are able to see the source code of any of these samples.

[TOC] Abstract One of the most anticipated Linux distribution for a long time now is Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. There has been so much speculation and gossip about it. Canonical finally lifts the curtain on that 12.04 LTS version, and let me already say it out loud ... it's a gem ! Introduction In this article we will show you how to download and install Ubuntu 12.04 as an alternative operating system for those who currently use only Windows 7 or 8. This tutorial, takes you by the hand and guides you step-by-step into easily tasks. Before we startup the how-to let me blast a quick pros'n'cons out of the Ubuntu's commercial hype and emphasize some remarkable spots about Ubuntu and why should we care about. Pros It is the most popular Linux distribution Easy to use (Noob friendly) and install software Thousands of applications (derived from Debian) It just works -- out of the box Huge community (your question is probably already answered) Valve Steam will be supported soon Cons Not the fastest Linux distro Unity desktop is still young bugs bunny lives Materials and Methods Downloading and Burning Ubuntu 12.04 To obtain a copy of Ubuntu, please launch your favorite browser (Firefox, Chrome, Opera, IE) and go to official Ubuntu website . Once you get there, you'll find many resources about Ubuntu. Click \" Get Ubuntu now \" in order to proceed. Alright, here we have the 32-bit version as recommended by Canonical. Despite what's it says, please select 64bit and click Start Download . The disk image of 64bit is called amd64 -- which is just bad name scheme in every aspect -- meaning that it supports both AMD and Intel 64bit processors . Currently you're downloading Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit for Desktop PC. After that, you have to choose in what media you want Ubuntu to be loaded. There are to 2 choices here: CD/DVD-Rom boot via USB. A. Using a CD/DVD Once you have downloaded Ubuntu ISO image disc, the next step is to burn it into a CD media. To accomplish this task, we are going to use ImgBurn . Launch ImgBurn utility and click \" Write Image file to disc \" button. Browse into your computer's hard drive directory, probably at your \" Downloads \" folder, locate ubuntu-12.04-desktop-amd64.iso and click \" Open \". Afterwards, please insert an empty (blank) CD-Rom into your DVD-Writer device and get ready to obtain a copy of Ubuntu. Burn the Ubuntu ISO disk image into an actual CD-ROM disc. Please wait while the disc has being writing... Congrats! Operation Successfully completed! Just in case, mark the CD-Rom's surface using an appropriate marker-pen that dries instantly. B. Using a USB flash disk First off, we need a USB Drive Disc. Do you have one ? Plug it in your PC and backup its contents, because they will be deleted/replaced by Ubuntu disc image. Again: backup your flash disk's data. Just don't say you weren't warned. Go to Unetbootin's webpage and download the Windows version. Afterwards, browse into your hard disk and locate the unebootin executable. Double click to launch the application. Select Disc Image , ISO and click the dots \"...\" button in order to locate the Ubuntu's ISO image file. Browse into your computer's hard drive directory, probably at your \" Downloads \" folder, locate ubuntu-12.04-desktop-amd64.iso and click \"Open \". Select USB Drive and the locate the approriate letter that matches in your flash drive. Eventually, hit \"OK\" button to start the conversion of your flash drive into a fully operational and bootable media including Ubuntu 12.04 64bit. Please wait a couple of minutes while the USB flash disk is getting ready. Congrats! Operation successfully completed! Now you have Ubuntu 12.04 inside your flash disk. Reboot your computer and boot from USB. First Boot Device First off, remove all unnecessary USB items to ease the process. Insert the bootable USB flash/CD-Rom drive that you just created in your target computer and restart you PC. Most newer computers can boot from a USB flash/CD-Rom drive. If your computer does not automatically do so, you might need to edit the BIOS settings. Restart your computer, and watch for a message telling you which key to press to enter the BIOS setup. It will usually be one of F1, F2, DEL, ESC or F10. Press this key while your computer is booting to edit your BIOS settings. Instead of editing BIOS settings, you can chose a boot device from the boot menu. Press the function key to enter the boot menu when your computer is booting. Typically, the boot screen displays which key you need to press. It maybe one of F12, F10. Note: with some motherboards you have to select 'hard disk/USB-HDD0' to choose the USB flash disk. You need to edit the Boot Order. Depending on your computer, and how your USB key was formatted, you should see an entry for \"removable drive\" or \"USB media\" or \"CD-Rom\". Move this to the top of the list to make the computer attempt to boot from the USB/CD-Rom device before booting from the hard disk. In case you have moden PC using UEFI Bios make the necessary changes in order to boot from USB or CD-Rom first, instead of hard drive. Take a look from ASUS UEFI BIOS: Otherwise if you own a MSI motherboard take a look below: Ok now, hit F10 keystroke (Save and Exit) and restart your PC in order to boot from CD-ROM or USB drive as to install Ubuntu. Booting Ubuntu The installation of the Ubuntu 12.04 distribution is a child's play in the hands of advanced users who already have the experience of re-installing operating systems. If you are newbie, please do not be afraid of installation. Using the manual and our helpful instructions, there is no doubt that you will accomplish this task quite easily. As we stated before, the installation procedure is quite an easy job, but is also a bit time consuming though (about 25 minutes). Pay attention to the instructions and be gentle with your computer. Please be aware of the fact that if you already use Windows 7 or 8, Ubuntu can be installed alongside or completely remove Windows. That's my old monitor, installing Ubuntu 12.04. As you can see I've already managed to boot from CD-Rom and Ubuntu distribution auto loads first, replacing your hard drive and MBR. Have a peak and let's do it together step-by-step. Select your language from the left menu and click \" Install Ubuntu \" to proceed with the Installation. Make sure that your have a wired internet connection via Ethernet , in case of inability to find wifi networks. Allocate drive's space Please check \" Download updates while installing \" and \" Install third-party software \". Use the checkboxes to choose whether you'd like to Install Ubuntu alongside another operating system, delete your existing operating system and replace it with Ubuntu, or – if you're an advanced user – choose the 'Something else' option Select the first option in order to dual boot with Windows 7/8 and Ubuntu, otherwise select the second option and delete Windows partition at all using only Ubuntu. Third option is not recommended for beginners. Dual boot means multi-booting, likewise the act of installing multiple operating systems on a computer, and being able to choose which one to boot when starting the computer. The term dual-booting refers to the common configuration of specifically two operating systems. Multi-booting may require a custom boot loader that Ubuntu installation provives and configures it automatically based upon your system's needs. Now hit \" Install Now \" and wait a couple of moments until the installation is complete. Please notice that Ubuntu needs about 4.5 GB to install, so add a few extra GB to allow for your files. Ubuntu asks you for ... During the instalaltion, Ubuntu asks you some questions about yourself. No, it doesn't ask you to go out for a beer. Just, like any other operating system, Ubuntu needs to configure itself... local time, language, keyboard layout, username etc... Check if your location is correct and click 'Continue' to proceed. If you're unsure of your time zone, type the name of the town you're in or click on the map and we'll help you find it. Select your prefered keyboard layout. Click on the language option you need. If you're not sure, click the ‘Detect Keyboard Layout' button for help. Afterward click \" Continue \" to proceed. Enter your login and password details. If you like check \" Log in automatically \" and press \" Continue \" to proceed. Ok that's it. Now sit back and wait while the system installs… And yeah, that's the final message saying that installation is complete. Please remove the CD-Rom or USB from your PC and hit \"Enter\" to reboot. Update and Upgrade Once you boot into Ubuntu 12.04 you will see the Desktop; this is Unity. Before you play around with your new toys, we recommended update your pre-installed applications to the latest version. Also, bug fixes and security updates will automatically installed. Follow the instruction below and take a look to the video. Open your terminal by typing \" terminal \" into Dash search field or press Ctrl+Alt+T sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade Results and discussion Now reboot your PC and you're ready to boot in back to the all brand new Ubuntu 12.04.

Introduction There are two ways to install the AMD drivers: Easy Way with Xorg-Edgers Hard way (Manual) from binaries Also, there are two ways to uninstall them if you need so: PPA purge if you used Xorg-Edgers Purge Autoremove if you used the manual way Materias and Methods Here we will see how to install, upgrade and uninstall the AMD drivers The easy way: Xorg-Edgers PPA for Catalyst Do you want to install a PPA once, then stay back and relax for life? If so, then follow the easy path that most Ubuntu users do. Xorg-Edgers offers you bleeding-edge drivers directly from upstream git, but in case of AMD Catalyst they always provide the latest stable AMD release, since AMD is not giving beta drivers in public (in contrast to NVIDIA). If you go to Xorg-Edgers Lauchpad profile, you will see the 2:8.980-0ubuntu1\\~xedgers\\~precise1 is already available. Additionally, these guys are so crazy that they even provide the driver for the Ubuntu 12.10 Alpha 3 release via fglrx 2:8.980-0ubuntu1\\~xedgers\\~quantal1. PPA Installation Anyway, add the PPA into your source and update/upgrade your packages. If you had already add Xorg-Edgers into your Ubuntu, there is no need to do it again. Just update your system and reboot. sudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get dist-upgrade sudo apt-get install fglrx-installer PPA Uninstallation In case you want to upgrade Ubuntu up to a new version (eg from Ubuntu 12.04 upgrade into Ubuntu 12.10) you have to remove this PPA or strange things will happen and maybe render unstable the whole system. So before you upgrade to the newer Ubuntu distro, please act wise and remove it.. sudo apt-get install ppa-purge sudo ppa-purge ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa So far, we have covered the easy method and now you should be able to install and remove them properly. You can stop reading now and reboot your PC. Have fun! The hard (manual) way First you will need to download the driver Click to download the drivers for 64/32 bit (the package contains both the 32-bit and 64-bit driver.).

There are two primary points you need to pay attention to: GPU model and Driver's version Introduction First lets get clear some things upfront about the Open Source VS Proprietary drivers. Ubuntu has an answer on that and comes with open source video driver by default, called Nouveau . There is no need to put any effort to install Nouveau because this driver is already, completely installed 100% from the first boot. However this one comes with a price - lacking of 3D acceleration meaning most games will not work and you will have performance issues. As a side effect, NVIDIA made available another driver -- not opensource but proprietary -- called NVIDIA Unified UNIX Graphics Driver . Having this one installed, you make use of your GPUs hardware potential to the fullest and thus expect some serious performance boost. Nonetheless, we would like to notice that we do not aim to go into open vs close source anticipation, but to provide you with something you can play games and benchmark your hardware, without problems. Truth to be told, the open source driver is struggling to perform or play modern games, thus we recommend using NVIDIA Unified UNIX Graphics driver; but if you are not much of a gamer guy, then nouveau will do the job as well. Materials and Methods All in all, if you are serious about high-performance and gaming, you already know that NVIDIA proprietary driver is what you need. In this section we will cover the following topics: Identify your GPU model Install/Uninstall Nvdia driver Using our own Nvidia Installer Script Using PPA Using the officialy provided (compiling) method Identify your GPU model In Linux, what a video driver does is allowing OpenGL API to interact with the graphics card. Pay attention, that nVIDIA provides many different versions for Linux, meaning that your first concern is to identify which version/driver is suitable for your GPU. To answer that question you need to know your GPU's model (eg GeForce GTX680, GeForce Ti4200, TNT Riva etc) and then look for its name into their hardware support lists. To identify your hardware, instead of using a terminal-based command you can go to \" System Settings \" and click on the \" Details \" icon. Now you know what hardware you are running at your PC and you can search for the appropriate driver. Installation Installation can be acomplished by using any of the following methods: Using our own Nvidia Installer Script Using PPA Using the officialy provided (compiling) method Nvidia Installer Script We recommend you to download and run our script which will automatically installs Xorg-Edge drivers. The script automatically removes opensource drivers (if any), nvidia proprietary old drivers (if any), blacklists and removes the appropriate modules and last but certainly not least, fixes sources and installs the latest nVIDIA drivers drivers and restarts your PC. Please try our script. Download our Installer Script Please add execute permission to the script then run the script: chmod +x installer_nvidia.sh sh ~/Downloads/installer_nvidia.sh Using PPA Do you want to install a PPA once, then stay back and relax for life? If so, then follow the easy path that most Ubuntu users do. Two choices here, but pick one: xorg crack pushers (aka Xorg-edgers) or Ubuntu-X . The difference between these two PPA is that Xorg-Edgers offers you bleeding-edge drivers directly from upstream git, while X-Swat provides you a safer -- recommended -- upstream releases. Latest ( maybe unstable ) drivers sudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install nvidia-current Latest but stable drivers sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install nvidia-current Warning : In case you want to upgrade Ubuntu up to a new version (eg from Ubuntu 12.04 upgrade into Ubuntu 12.10) you have to remove this PPA or strange things will happen and maybe render unstable the whole system. So before you upgrade to the newer Ubuntu distro, please act wise and remove it.. Unistall the PPA sudo apt-get install ppa-purge sudo ppa-purge ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates Or if you used xorg-edgers: sudo ppa-purge ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa After upgrading to the newer version of Ubuntu, you should re-able the PPA in order to get updates based on the new branch related to your new distro. Unistall the NVIDIA Unified and Restore Nouveau If for some reason you want to remove the nVIDIA unified Driver and go back into Nouveau opensource stuff, then follow the instructions bellow. sudo apt-get purge nvidia sudo apt-get install nouveau So far, we have covered the easy method and now you should be able to install and remove them properly. You can stop reading now and reboot your PC. Have fun ;) Using the officialy provided (compiling) method WARNING : Pay attention that every time you update you kernel, you should repeat the whole procedure. Otherwise you will end up with a broken X server. In contrast to the PPA method, compiling the module by yourself it's not what Ubuntu tastes, especially when there are two Launchpad teams who provide you the dinner well served. So doing all that by hand is pointless. Still reading ah? If you consider yourself as person who posses significant knowledge on Linux and basic bash terminal commands, then feel free to compile the NVIDIA driver module on your own . There's nothing wrong doing things manually; grasp deep knowledge of things who, which, where and what is happening into your system. So, after identifying yours GPU model, go to NVIDIA webpage and browse into the Supported Products tab, looking for your model. If you purchased your GPU during the past 5 years then it's probably supported by the Latest Long Lived Branch version and Latest Short Lived Branch version. The difference between these two is that the Long Live Branch is something like Ubuntu LTS -- meaning only security updates and bugfixes. If you can't find your model' name nowhere on that list, then you should look under the Legacy stuff. Supposing you own a long fashioned GPU, nVIDIA provides you their Legacy Driver -- support for very old models, such as TNT2, GeForce3/4 Ti/MX/FX series etc. Eventually, we recommend you to install the Short Lived Branch version -- no fear. Here is a step-by-step guide to do it. Download the driver wget -qO- ftp://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/XXXXXXX.run Kill the X server Press Ctrl+Alt+F1 or F2 or F3 or F-whatever otherwise type the command: sudo chvt 1 && sudo service lightdm stop where chvt 1 is tty1 = equal to Ctrl+Alt+F1 where chvt 2 is tty2 = equal to Ctrl+Alt+F2 where chvt 3 is tty3 and so on... Disable nouveau sudo modprobe -b vga16fb sudo modprobe -b nouveau sudo modprobe -b rivafb sudo modprobe -b nvidiafb Remove nouveau packages sudo apt-get --purge remove xserver-xorg-video-nouveau sudo update-initramfs -u Reboot sudo shutdown -r 0 Remove all nvidia* packages in the system and remove all the nvidia kernel objects currently installed sudo dpkg -l | grep nvidia | awk ' { print $ 2 }' | xargs sudo aptitude -y purge export kernel_version='uname -r' sudo rm -f 'find /lib/modules/ $ kernel_version -iname nvidia.ko' Install the new driver sudo sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86-*.run Enable the Desktop sudo service lightdm start Results and Discussion Alright let's round things up. The NVIDIA Unified drivers are way better than Nouveau since they provide 3D acceleration. The greatness of NVIDIA is their combination of decent performance and low noise levels and as such this dynamic shifted through their GPUs. It is common knowledge that their Linux drivers are way immature comparing to Windows, hence lot's of features are not implemented. On the other side of the scope, we also have to acknowledge that this driver is pitted against to a currently zero-market, since there is no actual profit from Linux gaming. But soon, things will change and then we will be happy to edit this article.

I am not 100% certain what had caused this but I have found the one to blame: AppArmor It seems that the version of AppArmor that is present in Ubuntu 11.10, doesn't let DHCP to establish a network connection. So in the meantime I have a permanet workaround. This will put DHCP daemon in a complain mode so that it will not be enforced by AppArmor to not make connection and so DHCP will just be let alone. Here is what you can do only once: First install apparmor utilities from Software Center or from terminal: sudo apt-get install apparmor-utils Then in your terminal login as a root!

There is a respectful amount of software out there that do things in the most easy way. But what happens when you want to use terminal and you just want to do things in a much easier way and not getting tired of typing? In computing, alias is a command in various command line interpreters (shells) such as Unix shells, 4DOS/4NT and Windows PowerShell, which enables a replacement of a word by another string. This way a long line of command can be replaced by simple human-understandable words. The file that incorporates all the aliases can be found either in home users folder .bashrc or .bash_aliases or in a system wide used folder /etc/bashrc or /etc/bash.bashrc The general synax of adding aliases is by adding lines in the following manner: alias NICKNAME='full command here' Where the NICKNAME is a word/name that you will remember and invoke the 'full command here' part of the aliases. So for system maintenance purposes we will add some useful aliases. Open a terminal window and type : gedit .bashrc This will open the Gedit Editor so that we can add the following lines at the end of the file alias Update='sudo apt-get update' alias Upgrade='sudo apt-get upgrade' alias Install='sudo apt-get install' alias Clean='sudo apt-get autoremove && sudo apt-get autoclean && sudo apt-get clean' alias Editaliases='gedit ~/.bashrc' Save and close the terminal. You may need to logout and login back or type bash and hit enter to make the changes take effect. This way you can just type: Install vlc to install the vlc software. Some notes for the above aliases: The first letter of the NICKNAME is by purpose in capital letter so that we avoid to use some system reserved alias that we may not aware of. The aliases are distribution agnostic. Just change the debian commands with the one that resembles your distributions commands You can add as many aliases as you can remember to make your life easier in the command line world. A quick last tip: If you want to install a software that comes with a bunch of packages (.deb) you can add the following alias to avoid typing all the names of the packages: alias Multinstall='sudo dpkg -i *.deb' For example you have download Optimus Kernel and you see that it comes with multiple \".deb\" files.

Any user who has ever used Ubuntu or any Debian derivative knows that the best way to have their system in a good shape and secure, must use the Update Manger to regularly check for any system and software updates. But that's one part of the procedure where most users usually stop. What about the packages that where downloaded for update reasons and now they are not needed and they reserve free space ? What about packages that where installed to satisfy dependencies for some packages and that are no more needed ? What about packages and configuration files which are not required by any other package upon your system ? What about the stored archives in your cache for packages that are no longer in the repositories or that have a newer version in the repositories ? Well, unfortunately the Update Manger doesn't deal with the above problems and do not provide any means to resolve them.

Upon 10 years of experience on Linux distributions some of the hottest issues that I came across are: Does compiling from source provide real and sensible performance boosts for overall the operating system ? Does compiling and removing unnecessary options from Linux Kernel provide real system boost ? Well for sure, Gentoo Linux users will give a definite answer : YES! There is not one scientific answer to this question. But for the following question: Does changing the Kernel Scheduler provide real and sensible performance boosts for overall the operating system ? We give the answer: YES !

The most notable parts of FFmpeg are libavcodec , an audio/video codec library used by several other projects, libavformat , an audio/video container mux and demux library, and the ffmpeg command line program for transcoding multimedia files. We can read on Wikipedia page for Zenity: Zenity is a cross-platform program that allows the execution of GTK+ dialog boxes in command-line and shell scripts. So we have the recording \"Kernel\" which is the FFmpeg libraries, and we have \"Zenity\" for dealing with some simple user interactions for Bash Script applications. And that was it !

Stay tuned for 32bit packages Update (15-Mar-2012) : Because now I don't use Zen Kernel but I build my own BFS/BFQ patched Ubuntu kernels, I removed the Zen Deb repo and created a new one \"Optimus Linux Kernel\" Update (15-Mar-2012) : Added 32bit packages to the downloaded ziped archive","tags":"Utappia Projects","loc":"http://utappia.org/bfs-bfq-optimized-linux-kernel-packages-ready-for-install.html","title":"BFS – BFQ optimized linux kernel packages ready for install"},{"text":"For some time now, I have stopped using the Linux kernel that comes bundled with the Ubuntu operating system and use a version that has a different approach on the matter of kernel schedulers . \"Scheduler\" is a time-resource-manager (task scheduler) who determines which process and how much it employs the processor (CPU) of the computer. The official scheduler of the Linux kernel is the CFS. In the past, I made several experiments (benchmarks) to see if I could find any noticeable difference in performance of my system by optimizing the kernel and changing the scheduler. The results of the experiments did not give me any reasonable grounds for the necessity of optimizing the Linux Kernel, let alone to change the scheduler of the kernel on modern machines. Nevertheless I continued to use a Linux Kernel with the BFS scheduler (see my article here : [Greek] Optimizing Ubuntu Linux Kernel with BFS - BFQ ) and of course to optimize the kernel according the specs of my machine. But yesterday, something really unexpected happened and I saw before my eyes the huge difference in performance that can give a Linux Kernel scheduler not only to an old PC but also to a modern PC with 4GB DDR3 RAM and a Intel i7 Quad Core CPU !! Preface: Completely Fair Schedule (CFS): To quote Wikipedia \"The Completely Fair Scheduler is the name of a task scheduler which was merged into the 2.6.23 release of the Linux kernel . It handles CPU resource allocation for executing processes, and aims to maximize overall CPU utilization while also maximizing interactive performance.\" CFS is the standard scheduler for Android. As such it is compatible with all apps and processes run in Android Brain FUCK Scheduler (BFS): To quote Mr. Con Kolivas , the developer of BFS \"BFS is the Brain Fuck Scheduler . It was designed to be forward looking only, make the most of lower spec machines, and not scale to massive hardware. ie it is a desktop orientated scheduler, with extremely low latencies for excellent interactivity by design rather than \"calculated\", with rigid fairness, nice priority distribution and extreme scalability within normal load levels.\" Google looked at BFS to use as the Android scheduler but decided that it wasn't mature enough yet. Experiment: In this experiment I used a 1,6 GB video file (.MOV) 40 minutes long and started to render it on 720p resolution. The system had the same Uptime and same conditions. The screenshot was taken on the same percentage so that we can have a fair measurement on \"estimated completion time\". I repeated this experiment for about 10 times, keeping the same conditions and it gave me the same results. Now this is what I got : As you can see with the BFS scheduler the \"Job\" will be completed in half of the time that CFS needs. One observation that can not be seen in a picture is that with BFS the CPU had a constant and steady 98-100% CPU utilization, in contrast with CFS the CPU utilization was dropping from time to time to 25%.

We talked about iQunix OS and how I got involved with Linux in general. The email was, as follows: Hello, My name is Jonathan Nadeau and I'm the owner of Frostbite Systems located at http://www.frostbitesystems.com, I have a podcast called Frostcast located at http://www.frostbitemedia.org I'm interviewing project leaders of different GNU / Linux distros along with free software. I'm wondering if you would be interested in doing an interview for the podcast? If you are interested please let me know and we can set something up. Thank you for your time and help. -Jonathan Nadeau After that, we arranged a day/time for interview that you can download in mp3/ogg formats: ~~ Interview with Salih Emin, Project Leader of IQUnix mp3 ~~ ~~ Interview with Salih Emin, Project Leader of IQUnix ogg ~~ Please accept my apologies for my awful English :P Update : The website seems down so I found a segment of the mentiond interview in an other show called Linux For The Rest Of Us so here is the segment: iQunix review","tags":"Utappia Projects","loc":"http://utappia.org/interview-with-frostbite-media-on-iqunix-os.html","title":"Interview with Frostbite Media on iQunix OS"},{"text":"I am pleased to present to you a Linux distribution that I had in my mind for a while and was able to release it recently. The distribution is called iQunix and it is an Ubuntu based distribution. It is pronounced as i-qu-nix ( iqunix pronounce ), and the focuses (or at least it tries to) on the respect that a simple *nix oriented operating system that should have on the intelligence (iq) of the end-user :) Introduction Most Linux distributions come along with pre-installed applications, beautiful graphics, docks, gorgeous icons, that in most cases you will inevitably change or modify them. For instance, when someone completes the installation of Ubuntu, the system has already applications pre-installed usually OpenOffice , Firefox, Evolution, MeMenu, Gwiber, Transmission and some other apps that the end-user may not even be aware of. The average user will ignore them and use his preferred applications like Chrome instead of Firefox, VLC instead of Totem Movie Pl, Twitter and Facebook instead of Gwiber and so on. Also the more experienced users will try to uninstall, all the applications that are in no use for them. In contrast iQunix OS is just the Operating System with a clean Gnome desktop environment . There is just the minimum software stack that is required to make a functional desktop environment and actually nothing is pre-installed. This way iQunix lets the user decide how should his desktop look like and what applications he needs, respecting his intelligence. What's included Gedit -- Simple text editor Terminal -- For those who know the power of linux shell (2Click Update) now callded uCareSystem. A simple, yet intuitive system maintenance app Nautilus -- The best file manager to manage your files and folders Remastersys To make a backup of your entire operating system with all your installed programs Hardware Drivers installer. To automatically detect you systems graphic card and wireless network card and install the appropriate drivers Synaptic Package Manager. To install the programs of your choice. Users of iQunix can immediately start using Synaptic Package manager to install additional software, add his favorite icons, themes and wallpapers from Gnome Eyecandies , or from where ever he wants. Advantages - Disadvantages Let's see what are the advantages and disadvantages if you decide to use iQunix OS Benefits Speed – It is just the operating system without any preinstalled applications. Ubuntu by nature -- with all the available apps that are used by millions of users. Support from the community of Ubuntu -- A Google search on any topic combined with the word \"Ubuntu\" will return millions of results, user tips, articles and how-to's. It is lightweight without unnecessary system services running in the background Disadvantages Adjustment Time, a necessary period of time is needed to adjust the system based on user needs. It gives the same user experience offered by Windows, in which the OS is \"empty\" of applications and users must install the applications such as Office, Browser, Video Player, Music Player etc. Core system environment the power of choice and freedom is where the end user decides what he wants to install and not. It is a bit \"ugly\" the end user decides according to his aesthetic criteria of how beautiful should the desktop environment look like Target Group Average users If you have ever installed Ubuntu (at least once), added your favorite applications and you have used it every day, then iQunix is the ideal environment to build your unique desktop environment. Experienced users iQunix is also suitable for those who prefer to have control of their system, from the ground up and to decide what should and what should not be installed. Usually these users are those who want the power of Debian without sacrificing the \"amenities\" offered by Ubuntu. Professionals In work environments, professionals usually use a minimum sets of applications that are necessary for their work. iQunix is ideal for professionals because they get only the operating system on which they can install the applications that are necessary for their work. This way their \"workstation\" is not overloaded by unnecessary applications and thus making the system unstable. Researchers If you are a researcher and use for example only one application (e.g Matlab) for complex mathematical algorithms, iQunix is the ideal environment because it does not compromise your system resources with applications and background services that are not in use. Support Ubuntu project has been committed to a regular release cycle and has managed to deliver on that commitment without fail. As mentioned before, iQunix is based on Ubuntu, therefore it will follow the regular system maintenance updates provided by the Ubuntu community and Canonical. The current version of iQunix is based on Ubuntu 10.10 (it has all the system updates that have been released for Ubuntu since October 2010) and hence it will receive software maintenance updates until April 2012. Finally, in future and depending on the needs I will provide some Patches and Wizards that can be run by the end user. Epilogue As a Linux user you know what are your needs therefor, iQunix offers a clean environment with the known \"easy to use\" desktop of Ubuntu, to customize it according those needs. As your needs are personal and different from others, why should your OS not differ?","tags":"Utappia Projects","loc":"http://utappia.org/iqunix-os-clean-fast-and-simple-os.html","title":"iQunix OS: Clean, Fast and Simple OS"},{"text":"\"Everybody wants to do something to help, but nobody wants to be first.\" Donation We have put, time and effort to bring out the best of our self for this project.
